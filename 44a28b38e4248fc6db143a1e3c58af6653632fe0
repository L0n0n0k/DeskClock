      "message": "For the record, Google Clock doesn\u0027t handle these in the TimerService anymore. They are processed in TimerReceiver, a broadcast receiver. The reason:\n\nThese Intents are typically fired from the actions on notifications. Framework makes no hard guarantees about how long it may take to deliver an Intent to a service. Clock is looking to be as punctual as possible here, given that these manipulate time-sensitive states (e.g. pausing a running timer).\n\nThe most reliable way to get realtimeish behavior from framework here is to have those notifications deliver broadcasts that are marked as foreground. In those cases, framework calls immediately, but only grants the receiver 5s to perform its work before ANRing. This is more than enough time for Clock\u0027s needs.\n\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/third_party/java_src/android_app/deskclock/java/com/android/deskclock/timer/TimerReceiver.java\n\nIn particular, notice these lines: .addFlags(Intent.FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND",
