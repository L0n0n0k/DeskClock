That is, if the task is scheduled for midnight, it *can* actually execute at midnight - 1ms. Ensure all callers of these APIs are actually supplying a non-zero offset (if they are sensitive to time of day) or you *will* encounter bugs.\n\ne.g. time is supposed to update every minute, but draws the same hour:minute value 2 consecutive minutes and then appears to \"jump 2 minutes ahead\" on the 3rd minute.",
